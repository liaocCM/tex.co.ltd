# Frontend Rules

## Code standards

- TypeScript strict typing; avoid `any`
- Use functional components and hooks
- Keep state local unless shared across routes

## API integration

- Use typed request/response models
- Handle pagination, errors, and empty states
- Do not assume backend fields not in contract

## UX completeness

- Provide loading, empty, error, and success states
- Ensure keyboard navigation for primary actions

## README notes

- Include install, dev server, build, and test commands
- Record environment variables and defaults

## Review checklist

- Lint passes
- No unused dependencies
- Components aligned to UI IDs
