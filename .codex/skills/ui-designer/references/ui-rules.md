# UI Rules

## Wireframe conventions

- Label each screen with an ID (UI-1, UI-2, ...)
- Show primary actions, secondary actions, and key data fields
- Indicate required data fields using [data:field]
- Include empty, loading, and error placeholders

## Flow notation

- Use arrows for navigation (UI-1 -> UI-2)
- Annotate triggers (click, submit, error)
- Mark gated paths (auth-required, role-required)

## Accessibility and UX

- Indicate focus order for primary actions
- Note any keyboard-only paths when relevant
- Avoid dense layout; prioritize clarity over fidelity

## Assumptions

- List assumptions at the end of each doc section
- If assumptions affect requirements, file a CR
