# RFC Log

## RFC: Clarify frontend modification request
From: CTO
To: User
Reason:
Frontend change request lacks scope, target files, and acceptance criteria.
Questions:
- Which page/component should change?
- What exact UI/behavior change is expected?
- Any constraints (brand, copy, layout, responsiveness)?
Impact if unanswered:
Cannot assign implementation tasks or approve frontend edits.
CTO Approval Needed: No
