A role-based agent skills system that simulates a real software company.

The system uses a CTO-centric orchestration model where specialized skills collaborate through structured artifacts (specs, architecture, design, code, tests, deployment), stored in shared memory across the software development lifecycle.

Communication is intentionally constrained to reduce noise, prevent spec drift, and maximize execution quality.
